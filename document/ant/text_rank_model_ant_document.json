    "hyp": "I could not imagine how does the ant would test as a meal but I have eaten it accidentally several time and one thing I was sure of is that It's smell was not really good. But judging from the picture I could say that it might test like Thai papaya salad which I really love. One Internet expert says the formic acid in ants makes them taste citrusy, like a lemon. Ants are edible and there are people that eat them as a delicacy not usually as primary source of food. It is something thats not easy to find even for the locals. In fact, Ive even seen an ant topping on a dessert in a Michlein star restaurant in France. Ants, especially red ones, produce formic acid to sting predators, capture food and defend themselves. Ants are quite edible and are widely consumed all over the world. So some bold star restaurants do ants as well. Also, insects use less water and other resources pound for pound to provide protein. In some countries in South America, they sell chocolate covered ants. So don’t be too surprised to see more insect farms/ranches in the future… leg of cricket anyone?. But that may change in the near future, more specifically there are some people forecasting/predicting that insects will have to be a much greater source of protein by the year 2050 if global population increases at or near It's current trend. Actually i didnt try it but as i know ants contain formic acid.",
    "ref": "Ants are edible. Ant are widely consumed all over the world for examples Laos, India, South America, France, and most popular in Thailand especially the north and northern part of the country. Ants can be found in many dishes for instance ants and ants egg salad, ants chocolate, ants omelette or omelet. Ants have high protein and have sour taste like lemon  because they have acid."

Actually i didnt try it but as i know ants contain formic acid. They have songs and dance performances just for the methods to get ant eggs from the trees. In some tribal areas in India, like Bastar, they make a chutney (dip) with ground ants. It becomes part of Northeasts culture even. In facts, it is widely eaten, especially, in North and Northeast of Thailand. It is so good idiet food because it has less fat and calories than chicken eggs. Not sure, so please dont flame me if the name of the restaurant is wrong. So I think if I have a chance I might try it.",

But judging from the picture I could say that it might test like Thai papaya salad which I really love. One Internet expert says the formic acid in ants makes them taste citrusy, like a lemon. Ants are edible and there are people that eat them as a delicacy not usually as primary source of food. It is something that's not easy to find even for the locals. In fact, I've even seen an ant topping on a dessert in a Michlein star restaurant in France. Ants, especially red ones, produce formic acid to sting predators, capture food and defend themselves. Ants are quite edible and are widely consumed all over the world. So some bold star restaurants do ants as well. Also, insects use less water and other resources pound for pound to provide protein. In some countries in South America, they sell chocolate covered ants. So don’t be too surprised to see more insect farms/ranches in the future… leg of cricket anyone?. But that may change in the near future, more specifically there are some people forecasting/predicting that insects will have to be a much greater source of protein by the year 2050 if global population increases at or near its current trend. Actually i didn't try it but as i know ants contain formic acid.",
    "ref": "Ant egg is eatable and being eaten in many part of the world mainly in Asian country. It is a source of protein. Most of the time it is served as an omelet. It is so popular in some part of Thailand and even become a culture to eat ant egg."

Actually i didn't try it but as i know ants contain formic acid. They have songs and dance performances just for the methods to get ant eggs from the trees. In some tribal areas in India, like Bastar, they make a 'chutney' (dip) with ground ants. It becomes part of Northeast's culture even. In facts, it is widely eaten, especially, in North and Northeast of Thailand. It is so good idiet food because it has less fat and calories than chicken eggs. Not sure, so please don't flame me if the name of the restaurant is wrong. So I think if I have a chance I might try it.",

The essence of happiness could be found in every corner that we walk and everyone around us was truly blown by the excitement of the festival, I love this way of celebrate so much. This is what I think the best way how to troll the new year that could make everyone enjoy pulse clame down from the heat of the summer. During the festival period in Thailand, everything and everyone just became ten time more joyful with special energy and kindness. This is the festival that I have been last two summers ago and I could tell you all that the experience with this festival is priceless. However, this festival has a clear purpose: reuniting the family and cleaning you for a fresh start in the New Year. I couldn’t run around the city without seeing people smile, splashing water on others and wishing worlds. Something magical about seeing so many people smile and have tons of fun.There are so many beautiful rituals that has been around for over 1,380 YEARS!",

    "hyp": "I think the Japanese people do not really stay abroad for a long time even though the travelling. To some extent it means Japan would like to give many other countries passports the same convenient. what i got from japaness culture is that they are working really hard and they take every thing so hard, from education, working in office and even life, so they really are working to have in impact in whole world market in term of technology but they also want to have an impact in whole world in term of politics. First of all, Japanese people are so accustomed to their own culture that living overseas would be rather uncomfortable. I was so jealous of him, which every country could have the freedom to travel liken the japanese. Second of all, Japanese are rich and would like to make business. While staying there I couldn't travel to any other country while my Japanese friend could just book flight tickets and goes anywhere he want. so when they are working so hard its good to see such thing and is expected from such country. I knew the feeling of holding the most powerful passport on earth very well, I went to a country in the north Africa with my friend from Japan and we stayed there for more than two months. They go to other countries for travel or making trade. Firstly, I though it might be any country from Europe like maybe France, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands since UK and France have colonised countless amount of country during the colonisation era, so there might be some connections remains between those countries. They concern about the visa period rather than stay illegal. I guess that is the reason they are considered as welcomed and harmless by many governments.",

There are so many beautiful rituals that has been around for over 1,380 YEARS!. It is very important for Thai people, and honestly, it is a lot of fun!. I really have to say Songkran is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable festival. Of course, the name of the festival differs depending on country but the festival duration takes place in the same month, April. I remember there were a guy who has that kind of big tank at his back while pumping a large stream of water from the gun, it was really cool!",
